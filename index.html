As someone who’s been a student my whole life, I’ve come across my fair share of effective and ineffective instructors. The reality is that we never stop learning, whether we are in an office, street, or home setting. On the flip side of this ecosystem, we rarely ever stop teaching. Countless relationships demonstrate this connection; that of a mentor/mentee, a parent/child, a stranger/stranger, and you/yourself. Though the environments and contexts people interface with others or themselves may seem quite different at first, the crux of each interaction is the same: to deliver information in a parsable manner for easy absorption.
